Parallelisation strategy
------------------------

The code is designed based on the following assumptions:

1. Input data are stored in individual 2D slices. Reading part of a single slice requires reading the whole slice into memory, and this is an expensive operation.
2. Writing a single chunk of output data is an expensive operation.
3. Reading a single chunk of output data is a cheap operation.

If we have input slices of shape ``(nx, ny)``, and an output chunk shape of ``(nc, nc, nc)`` it makes sense to split the conversion into individual 'slabs' that have shape ``(nx, ny, nc)``.
This means there is a one-to-one mapping from slices to slabs, and slabs to chunks, allowing each slab to be processed in parallel without interfering with the other slabs.

Third-party multi-threading
---------------------------
``stack-to-chunk`` turns off third-party multi-threading in ``blosc`` when running.
This allows the ``n_processes`` argument to be respected when set to ``1``, and
prevents issues when ``stack_to_chunk`` uses a larger number of parallel processes.

Zarr group layout
-----------------
The zarr groups produced by ``stack-to-chunk`` contain zarr arrays that are labelled 0, 1, 2, 3... etc.
The array at ``0`` is the full-resolution dataset, and each subsequent array is downsampled by a factor of :math:`2^{i}`.
