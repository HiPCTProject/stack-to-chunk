## Contributing

This code is designed and specialised to work with data from the [HiP-CT project](https://mecheng.ucl.ac.uk/hip-ct/), but openly available in the hope it might be useful for other people or groups.
Bug reports and fixes are very welcome - please open at least an issue and then optionally a pull request to fix the issue.

New functionality might be welcome, depending on whether it is in scope of the package and how much maintenance burden it would add.
For new features please open an issue to discuss first before developing anything to avoid wasted effort!
